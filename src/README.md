# Source code

This is where things get a bit messy.
The results published in the paper were obtained by the Fortran code included here. This should be it, although I am not sure if I did not try some test after publication and left it in. I often do this and am unable to check.

The C files are C translations of the Fortran code, but again I cannot be sure of the version. Looking at them, I see that the second is posterior and computes the assignment bound at each tree search node (relevant code at the and of the file).
