The software and data in this repository are a snapshot of the software and data
that were used in the research reported on in the paper 
[Exact and Approximate Nondeterministic Tree-Search Procedures for the Quadratic Assignment Problem](https://doi.org/10.1287/ijoc.11.4.358) by V.Maniezzo. 
This paper was awarded the _INFORMS Journal of Computing_ Test of Time Paper Award for 1996-2000.
Some 25 years later, V. Maniezzo found the associated code on a hard-drive, and we make the code available here for historical interest.

## Description

The code and data in this repository are those left on my hard disk at the time of publication. The original code is in Fortran, a language I can no longer use. I moved to ANSI C immediately afterwards, and there are actually two translations, but they are post-publication works, possibly incomplete.

The fortran code makes use of R.E. Burkard's linear assignment routine for which I can find no reference, but it is cited in the paper.

## Results

Besdes the results reported in the paper, I found one results table contained in an Excel file that I include in the results section of the repository.

## Replicating

I am currently unable to reproduce the tests as I have never used Fortran since. However, I will be happy to include instructions on how to rebuild the code using widely available open source Windows compilers.
