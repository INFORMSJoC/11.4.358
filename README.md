## Description

The code and data in this repository are those left on my hard disk at the time of publication. The original code is in Fortran, a language I can no longer use. I moved to ANSI C immediately afterwards, and there are actually two translations, but they are post-publication works, possibly incomplete.

The fortran code makes use of R.E. Burkard's linear assignment routine for which I can find no reference, but it is cited in the paper.

## Results

Besdes the results reported in the paper, I found one results table contained in an Excel file that I include in the results section of the repository.

## Replicating

I am currently unable to reproduce the tests as I have never used Fortran since. However, I will be happy to include instructions on how to rebuild the code using widely available open source Windows compilers.

## Support
